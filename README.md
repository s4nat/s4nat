## Distributed Systems
Distributed Systems and Computing is the field of study that powers various applications such as Blockchains, Cloud Services and P2P applications. It is a paradigm concerned with ensuring consistency, fault tolerance, and efficient communication among distributed components in a network of computing devices. Given below is the summary of the fundamental concepts underpinning this field.

Below are some of my personal projects in the area of Distributed Systems.

### DNS on Chord

DNS on Chord is a fault tolerant P2P Distributed Hash Table which aims to replace the legacy hierarchical structure of the current DNS network. When a user of DNS on Chord attempts to retrieve DNS records for a particular hostname from the legacy DNS network, it ports over the record to the distributed P2P network where a network participant contributes to hosting the record.
Some useful features of this protocol:
- Tolerates planned node departures
- Tolerates unplanned node deaths (due to replication of the records)
- Seamless node joins and redistribution of DNS records
- Fingertable which makes the lookup times for a record O(logN)
