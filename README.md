## Distributed Systems
Distributed Systems and Computing is the field of study that powers various applications such as Blockchains, Cloud Services and P2P applications. It is a paradigm concerned with ensuring consistency, fault tolerance, and efficient communication among distributed components in a network of computing devices. Given below is the summary of the fundamental concepts underpinning this field.

Below are some of my personal projects in the area of Distributed Systems.

### [DNS on Chord](https://github.com/s4nat/dns-chord)
ðŸ“‘[Original Chord Paper](https://example.com/path/to/your/file.pdf)

ðŸ“‘[DNS on Chord Report](https://github.com/s4nat/s4nat/files/15230838/50_041_Distributed_Systems_Project.pdf)

DNS on Chord is a fault tolerant P2P Distributed Hash Table which aims to replace the legacy hierarchical structure of the current DNS network. When a user of DNS on Chord attempts to retrieve DNS records for a particular hostname from the legacy DNS network, it ports over the record to the distributed P2P network where a network participant contributes to hosting the record.
Some useful features of this protocol:
- Tolerates planned node departures
- Tolerates unplanned node deaths (due to replication of the records)
- Seamless node joins and redistribution of DNS records
- Fingertable which makes the lookup times for a record O(logN)


### [Lamport's Clock](https://github.com/s4nat/lamport-clocks)

In distributed systems and computing, Lamport's clock is a fundamental concept used to establish a partial ordering of events that occur across multiple nodes without relying on a centralized clock. Lamport's clock assigns timestamps to events in a distributed system to maintain their causal ordering. If event A influences event B, Lamport's clock ensures that the timestamp of A is earlier than that of B. However, if events are concurrent, their timestamps may not follow a specific order.

Lamport's clock is useful for:

- Total ordering of events across distributed nodes
- Concurrency Control - detect causality violations

### Bully Algorithm
The Bully Algorithm is a classic election algorithm used in distributed systems to elect a leader among a group of nodes even in the event of node crashes. In distributed systems, having a single leader is often crucial for coordinating actions and ensuring consistent decision-making. Election algorithms like the Bully Algorithm facilitate the selection of a leader node that can oversee and coordinate the activities of other nodes in the system.

### Distributed Mutual Exclusion


### [IVY File System](https://github.com/s4nat/ivy)
Ivy is a multi-user read/write peer-to-peer file system. Ivy has no centralized or dedicated components, and it provides useful integrity properties without requiring users to fully trust either the underlying peer-to-peer storage system or the other users of the file system. This repo is a Go-based implementation of fault-tolerant Ivy Architecture with a backup central manager for consistent (meta)data handling during primary CM failures.

### [ByteBass](https://github.com/s4nat/bytebass)

ðŸ“‘[ByteBass Presentation](https://github.com/s4nat/s4nat/files/15236518/ByteBass.pdf)

ðŸ“‘[ByteBass Report](https://github.com/s4nat/s4nat/files/15236529/PLC.Report.pdf)

ByteBass is an application written entirely in C which takes bass guitar audio in wav file format and parses it to determine the musical notes being played. The parsed notes are then fed into a Finite State Machine which determine's whether the notes being played follow a musical certain scale or not.
